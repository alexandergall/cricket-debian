 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 15 Jan 2002 19:14:16 -0500

cricket (1.0.3-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix path to cricket-sm.gif in supplied Defaults file (thanks to Josip
    Rodin <joy@cibalia.gkvk.hr>)
  * Fix the config tree compiler to skip dpkg temporary and backup files
    (Closes: #127100)
  * Untaint data read from the config tree, which allows eval'd
    expressions there to work.  Thanks to Niko Tyni
    <ntyni+cricket@mappi.helsinki.fi> for the patch (Closes: #126778)
  * Give up on asking the user whether to abort installation if they don't
    want the config tree moved, and just display a note.  It is overly
    complex to try to do this right, and not worth it.
  * Adjust width/height hints to reflect what current rrdtool/libgd
    actually output

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Jan 2002 16:01:36 -0500

cricket (1.0.3-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force the rest of util/* programs to use the correct path to
    cricket-conf.pl, so that they can be configured there (part of
    #126782)
  * Add a documentation symlink sample-config -> examples, since the
    documentation, et al refer to sample-config.
  * Only present the note about moving the config tree when upgrading, not
    when installing from scratch (yes, again) Closes: #126971
  * Fix up the debconf question to actually ask a question in the short
    description

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Dec 2001 00:02:52 -0500

cricket (1.0.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hack up collect-subtrees to report errors correctly.  Rather than
    reading the logfile after finishing, just read the collector output
    from a pipe and copy it to the log, reporting errors along the way.
    (Closes: #123626)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Dec 2001 19:50:24 -0500

  * Allow for spaces and other garbage in filenames when moving the config
    tree (no bug yet, so hopefully this didn't burn anyone)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sun, 11 Nov 2001 14:07:19 -0500

cricket (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream stable release.
  * Very little changed from 1.0.3-pre4b, mostly documentation updates

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Nov 2001 21:55:52 -0500

cricket (1.0.2+1.0.3-pre4b-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updated to latest upstream development prerelease.  The code has
    stabilized for the official 1.0.3 release. (Closes: #107514)
  * User-visible highlights:
    - SNMP version 2 support
    - MAIL action tag for monitor thresholds
    - The entire config tree is now read into memory for better
      performance
    - Fast abort for SNMP queries to hosts known to be down
  * Now depend on libdigest-md5-perl instead of libmd5-perl, since the
    code has been updated to use the newer interface
  * Move libtime-hires-perl to Suggests, since it is only used by an
    optional auxiliary script
  * Install CGI scripts in /usr/lib/cgi-bin, and symlinks in
    /usr/share/cricket, the reverse from previous releases.  This
    eliminates the need for the webserver to follow symlinks
    (Closes: #116737)
  * Move the config tree from /etc/cricket to /etc/cricket/config, to make
    room for new Cricket configuration files that are not part of the
    config tree.  Warn the user via debconf before upgrading, and give
    them the chance to bail.
  * The full source code and config files have gone through
    reindentation.  This will cause a minor pain when upgrading your
    Defaults file, but it will reduce headaches in the long run.
  * We now do data collection using collect-subtrees by default, which
    should make it easier for folks who are using collect-subtrees anyway,
    and bring it to the attention of people who aren't using it.  To this
    end, modified collect-subtrees to support an ALL subtree which just
    collects everything.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Nov 2001 23:58:12 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix broken link in doc/html/index.html, to ../README.Debian
  * Add a symlink from doc/doc -> html, since much of the documentation
    tells the user to look at doc/blah.html

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Aug 2001 18:44:33 -0400

cricket (1.0.2-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add "missingok" option to logrotate config file, to keep it from
    failing if the collector is not running for whatever reason.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Jul 2001 03:39:12 -0400

cricket (1.0.2-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move html documentation to /usr/share/doc/cricket/html, and the
    neta-paper subdirectory to /usr/share/doc/cricket/neta-paper.

cricket (1.0.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove defined() around array to avoid perl-5.6 warning
    (Closes: #87794)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Feb 2001 18:12:40 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * postrm: Remember to remove /etc/cricket, /var/cache/cricket,
    /var/lib/cricket and /var/log/cricket on purge
  * rules: Cleanup, 
  * postinst: stricter permissions on /etc/cricket (only allow cricket
    user and group, as there could be passwords in there)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Feb 2001 23:17:36 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix perl dependencies to work with the new perl
  * Make sure we do the right thing in cron.daily if we are removed, but
    not purged (cron.d already did)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Feb 2001 14:07:21 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * postinst: Failsafe: make sure postinst doesn't fail if removal of
    /var/state/cricket on upgrade is unsuccessful
  * postinst: Use an if test to see if the cricket user exists, rather than
    backticks.  This keeps us from failing due to set -e if the cricket
    user does not exist yet (oops).

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Jan 2001 00:18:34 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * chdir to / before running the rest of cron.daily.  This prevents a
    harmless error (find: cannot open current directory: Permission
    denied).

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Jan 2001 17:12:53 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Create a cricket group in addition to the cricket user.  This allows
    us to stop creating files owned by nogroup, and avoid making anything
    writable by www-data.
  * The CGI scripts are now setgid cricket, to allow updating of
    /var/cache/cricket (which used to be writable by www-data).  As such,
    we now depend on perl5-suid.
  * Overview of cricket's permissions setup added to README.Debian
  * Minor changes to mini-graph.cgi and grapher.cgi so that they work in
    taint mode (necessary for sgid operation)
  * Run the cache-cleaning cron job as cricket, rather than as root.  It
    was probably safe, but now it's safer.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Tue,  9 Jan 2001 16:11:17 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Versioned dependency on librrds-perl.  It turns out that Cricket
    now requires version 1.0.10 or above, though this isn't mentioned in
    the installation documentation.  The required rrdtool version can be
    decoded from the version in 'use RRDs 1.000101', where 1.000101 refers
    to rrdtool 1.0.10, though the exact format doesn't seem to be
    documented in rrdtool either.  I removed this dependency in a previous
    version, but I have no idea why.  It should stay there.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu,  4 Jan 2001 23:35:37 -0500

cricket (1.0.2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a daily cron job to clean out /var/cache/cricket.  This
    directory can contain a fixed maximum number of files (determined
    roughly by the number of targets in the config tree), but once a file
    is created, it is almost never removed. (Closes: #80238)
  * Fixed some questionable upstream defaults.  I'd wanted to change these
    for a long time, but was hesitant to diverge from upstream, lest
    I break configuration compatibility and violate the principle of least
    surprise.  I have since learned that these defaults will be changed in
    the next upstream release (1.0.3), so I went ahead and made the
    changes.  They are:
    - Use bytes=false for the ifInOctets and ifOutOctets targets.  This
      means that kb/sec, mb/sec, etc. will be computed as powers of 10 (1k
      = 10^3 = 1000) rather than powers of 2 (1k = 2^10 = 1024).  Much
      discussion on the cricket-users list has revealed that this is what
      people expect.
    - Use rrd-ds-type=DERIVE and rrd-min=0 for the default datasource.  This
      means that new targets will be created so that if the current sample
      of a counter is less than the previous sample, it will be discarded.
      Previously, it would be assumed that the counter had overflowed, and
      rrdtool would try to correct for that, assuming a 32-bit or 64-bit
      counter.  This would cause large, bogus spikes when an SNMP device was
      reset.  The vast majority of users would rather lose a sample in this
      case (and when a counter overflow occurs) than get a bogus one.

cricket (1.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't compress examples, to avoid having some files compressed and not
    others.  This makes it easier to copy in the example configuration as a
    starting point (Closes: #74029).
  * Updated maintainer email address (now an official maintainer)

  * Added fix from cricket-users mailing list (\*:\s* should be \s*:\s*)
  * Another fix from the mailing list: scaled{$dslist[$i %numDSs]} should be
    scaled{$dslist[$i % $numDSs]} (generated an ugly message, but was
    apparently harmless)
  * Include THANKS with other documentation
